# GraphQL Conversion Search Engine [![MIT license](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://lbesson.mit-license.org/)

## Description

Given a MERN build search engine, I was asked to refactor it to utilize a GraphQL database with an Apollo Server. This was done by replacing the api routes that came with the application with typeDefs and a resolver on the server side. On the client side, queries and mutations were added to use instead of the normal API routes.

The starter code for this project was given by EdX for the CWRU Web Dev Coding Bootcamp. The necessary edits to convert it to an Apollo Server was done by me. Any additional assistance was given by my instructor, Ross Ritchey, and by utilizing the [Apollo Server Docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/).
